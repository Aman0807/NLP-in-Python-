Silicon Valley (TV Show on HBO) language analysis


**Silicon Valley** happens to be the most recent TV show that I have binged upon and I became a fan right off the bat. Everything from the content, plot, play etc appealed to me. 












For those of you, who haven't seen the show , this is a journey of a group of techies trying to build something using their tech-ablilities. This group reminded me of a similar(yet very diffenernt) group of guys from another TV show called *The Bing Bang Theory (TBBT)* which was also a very popular seires. Personally, I hated TBBT (I'm sorry !) even though there is similar core theme to both the shows.  

So, in this project I have tried to use **Natural Language Processing(NLP)** to figure out how Silicon Valley is diffenent from TBBT and whether the language used has affected my preferences.

We'll try to answer the following questions : 

    1. What kind of langage is used in Silicon Valley ?
    2. What sentiment does Silicon Valley carry on Twitter ?
    3. Comparison between the languages of Silicon Valley and TBBT.
